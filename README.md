# Tubular-Reactor-Optimisation
Optimal Temperature Trajectory for Tubular Reactor Using Physics Informed Neural Networks

PINN is used to solve the governing PDEs of a tubular reactor and an optimiser predicts the optimal temperature trajectory to maximise the prodcuts.
The code used SciANN library (SCIANN 0.6.8.3) available at https://www.sciann.com/
